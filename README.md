Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is impoertant to the industry as we are in the digital world and most of the things that we use are
  either apps or are in the cloud. Software engineering makes a lot of things possible, who knew we would get to a place where we order rides and food and it all happens on an app.
  many businessess are relient on software engineering because it helps simplify things and makes the economy stronger and safer.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The development of programming languages
- Establishment of software engineering as a discipline
- The rise of agile methodologies in

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Waterfall
  Approaches the software development in a sequence flowing down
- Scrum
  A framework that uses the approach of small, self organized teams working in sprints
- Agile
  This frame work rises sequencially focusing on flexibility and responds to change.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall methodology
  As is in the name, it  is like a waterfall as all the steps happen in a sequence like how water would fall in to a bucket or glass.
  Each and evry phase happens after the previous one completes, same as this very same course where you cant start the content of nextweek when the previous week is not  done.
  The examples are Construction Project of a house, the foundation is first and key then other parts come in after and in a sequence.
  Another expample is the Manufacturing of a car, you cant start putting the tires if the body of the car is complete.

- Agile methodology
  This methodology is interactive and flexible as it focuses more on continious feedback, collaborationand delivering working project in small increments.
  This methodology is good as it allows for frequent adaptations from the user basedon the given working project and getting feedback for changing the requirements. The examples where this is used is in Software Devlopment, Game development, Marketing campaigns 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer
- Writes the code and implement software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer
- Ensures software quality by making test plans to ensure the quality of sotware
Project Manager
- Oversees the whole project as a whole and its delivery

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- This tool is important for writing code, debugging and testing code. Examples are Visual Studio Code, Notepad++,Eclipse
VCS- This the tool used to  track the changes made by the team no matter how big or small are they. Knowing what was changed and being able to go back when needed 
is important as mistakes happen and being able to restore previous version that didn't have issues is important. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Tight deadlines
- To overcome these challanges we need to communicate all that goes on into creating a software solution and the time needed and how long changes takes and how they disturb the project  completion

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing
- This is when you test the individual components of the software to see if they fuction on their own
Integration
- This is when you test the components together and how they all function together
System
- This is when the whole system is tested as a whole

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering
  This is the practice of designing and refining inputs given to an AI model to get the most accurate outputs 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Write a story" - vague prompt
"Write me a fiction story and make it for under 10 year olds"
